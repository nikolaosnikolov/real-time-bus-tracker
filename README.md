# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description of project
This is an API driven project that has been done by importing a map and putting a marker on it, so you can understand where the excact location of a bus route is. It is made by using mapbox as a map template and all the others were done by HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## How to Run
If you want to run this project, just open the direct GitHub link https://nikolaosnikolov.github.io/real-time-bus-tracker/ on your web browser. Then click to the button 'Play route', and the route is going to start.
## Roadmap of future improvements
What I would try to do better in the future is maybe to change the route so I can put a big one and then put timer for how much time the people in the bus are going to wait until the next station. All these are going to follow a list of the whole stops and the time from the stop we are now to all the others.
