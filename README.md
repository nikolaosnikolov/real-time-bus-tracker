# Real Time Bus Tracker
## What is this project?
This is an API driven project that has been done by importing a map and putting a marker on it so you can understand where the excact location of a bus route. It is made by using mapbox as a map template and all the others were done by HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## How to run this project?
If you want to run this project on your machine you can just take all the files I have imported (not the README) in the same path and just run the HTML file. Then click to the button 'Play route', and the route is going to start.
## Future changes I would do
What I would try to do better in the future is maybe to change the route so I can put a big one and then put timer for how much time the people in the bus are going to wait until the next station. All these are going to follow a list of the whole stops and the time from the stop we are now to all the others.
